# House Price Prediction with ML

Here in house price prediction we used [house price prediction](https://github.com/kungumasakthivel/House-Price-Prediction/blob/main/HousePricePrediction.xlsx%20-%20Sheet1.csv) data set to develop a price prediction model with different machine learning algorithms.

To predict house price we need to consider lot of factors like location, year of build, size, number of rooms and more...

I have been used different machine learning algorithm that are follow:

* Support Vector Regression
* Random Forest Regression and
* Linear Regression

These algorithms are trained and tested its accuracy using MSE (mean squared error). This MSE helps to find the error difference between actual and predicted value. 

The MSE calculated value of actual and predicted data value should be low. So, we can assume that model has beed trained well without any underfitting or overfitting.
